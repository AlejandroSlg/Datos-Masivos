## Data Mining
Data mining is the process of finding anomalies, patterns and correlations within large data sets to predict outcomes. Using a broad range of techniques, you can use this information to increase revenues, cut costs, improve customer relationships, reduce risks and more.

Data mining allows you to:

-Sift through all the chaotic and repetitive noise in your data.
-Understand what is relevant and then make good use of that information to assess likely outcomes.
-Accelerate the pace of making informed decisions.

## Apache Spark
 Apache Spark is a general-purpose & lightning fast cluster computing system (a Framework) whereas Scala is a high-level programming language in which Spark is written.
 
 Scala is comparatively new to the programming scene, but has become popular very quickly. 
 
 A general-purpose programming language, Scala provides support for functional programming and a strong static type system.

It combines concepts of object-oriented and functional programming languages. It was developed to overcome the problems faced by other languages and can easily be integrated into existing code.

## What is Apache Spark?
Apache Spark is an open source, wide range data processing engine with revealing development APIâ€™s, that qualify data workers to accomplish streaming in spark, machine learning or SQL workloads which demand repeated access to data sets. It is designed in such a way that it can perform batch processing(processing of the previously collected job in a single batch) and stream processing (deal with streaming data). It is a general purpose, cluster computing platform.

Spark is designed in such a way that it integrates with all the Big data tools. For example, Spark can access any Hadoop data source and can run on Hadoop clusters. Spark extends Hadoop MapReduce to next level which includes iterative queries and stream processing.
